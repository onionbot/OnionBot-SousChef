### About 

![sauce](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32883278/97644522-6e8f9780-1a42-11eb-8672-963667e5b7dd.jpeg)

The OnionBot sous chef can:

- Automatically proceed through a complete pasta with tomato sauce recipe
- Advance through instructions hands-free, using image classification
- Autonomously control pan temperature using PID feedback control
- Detect when the pasta is boiling-over and turn down the heat!
- Remind you if you havenâ€™t stirred in a while, preventing your food from burning!

This simple recipe functionality only scratches the surface of what could be possible in the future with machine vision!

### Recipe example 

![flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32883278/97643676-4c951580-1a40-11eb-8298-1f67f483daaf.png)

An example of how the sous chef can use image classification to provide assitive functionality with a pasta boiling recipe. 


### System structure

`API.py` API for showing recipe steps (messages) on screen and controlling recipe progress

`main.py` Read recipes from files and walk through steps, sending commands to the main `OnionBot-API`

`recipes/*` Store process, model and screen message information on a recipe-by-recipe basis

### Known issues 

- This code is a proof of concept only for using `OnionBot-API` for recipe automation - it is hacky and buggy 
- Special functionality is hard coded into the main file, would be much neater to plug addons in via config files
- Only 2 recipes tested so far


### TODO 

- Test more recipes!
- Refactor to make code actually safe for human viewing


### The OnionBot idea was developed through a research project at Imperial College London
